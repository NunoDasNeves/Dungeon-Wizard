# Changelog

## v0.10.0 (2025-01-04)

***Misc***
- Added CHANGELOG.md

***Features***
- Spike pits!
    - Most creatures can't path over spikes, unless they can fly or dash over
    - Creatures can teleport/dash/be pushed onto spikes, at which point they take damage and are pushed out (toward the closest pathable tile)
    - So they're basically walls that you can see/shoot/dash over, and can push enemies into!
    - Added spike pits in existing maps and added a couple new maps
- Casting progress bar
- Casting time icons on cards (hourglasses)
- Fire damage visual hit effect
- New room exit doors
- Room rewards are now in chests which spawn after completing a room
- Additional VFX for spells and other things (flame dart, fire boom...)
- New shop room and NPC shopkeeper. He doesn't say much
- Slimes leave behind a nasty trail of goop. Eww! Don't step in it!
- Game window can be freely resized
- You can win the game without crashing it now! (Still no "proper" ending yet, there's a final room that's a little harder)

***Balance***
- Increase bat and sharpboi attack startup time
- Decrease gobbow damage
- Decrease impling hp and damage
- Wave spawning adjusted - instead of always spawning the next wave after a delay, it will wait until the current waves' strength is reduced below a threshold
