# Changelog

## v0.10.0 (2024-12-25)

***Misc***
- Added CHANGELOG.md

***Features***
- Spike pits
    - Creatures who don't fly (including the player (for now)) can't path over them
    - Creatures can teleport/dash/be pushed into them, at which point they take damage and are pushed out (toward the closest pathable tile)
    - So they're basically walls that you can see/shoot/dash over, and can push enemies into!
    - Currently bats are the only creatures who can fly over spikes
- Casting progress bar
- Casting time icons on cards  (hourglasses)
- Fire damage hit effect

***Balance***
- Put back casting times how they were, with smol adjustments
- Increase sharpboi attack startup

***Fixes***
-
